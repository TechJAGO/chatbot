            <li>Credentials might be wrong, try to re-add the credentials or make a new profile</li>
            <li>If it is a Windows device, login to end device and then do the following: <br /> Run -> Wbemtest -> Enter the required details. <br      /> If you are not able to connect then it is a device end issue and not OPM issue.</li>
            <li>For a network device, from OPM UI go to <br /> Setting -> Tools -> MIB Browser -> Enter the device name , credentials and from the left coloumn select any one from the list and click on "GET". If the credentials are correct then you will be able to get the info otherwise it will throw an error.</li>
